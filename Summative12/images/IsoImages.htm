<h2>What is an ISO image?</h2>
<p>ref: Wikipedia: An ISO image (.iso) is  a disk image of an ISO 9660 file system. It also refers to any optical disk image, even a UDF image.</p>
<p>As is typical for disk images, in addition to the data files that are contained in the ISO image, it also contains all the filesystem metadata (boot code, structures, and attributes).<br /> 
All of this information is contained in a single file.<br /> 
These properties make it an attractive alternative to physical media for the distribution of software that requires this additional information as it is simple to retrieve over the Internet.</p>
<p>Some of the common uses include the distribution of operating systems, such as Linux or BSD systems, and LiveCDs.</p>
<p>Most CD/DVD authoring utilities(Nero, Adaptec, Roxio, Toast, UltimateBurner3.0) can deal with ISO images: Producing them either by copying the data from existing media or generating new ones from existing files, or using them to create a copy on physical media.</p>
<p>Most operating systems (including Mac OS, Mac OS X, BSD, Linux, and Windows with Microsoft Virtual CD-ROM panel) allow these images to be mounted as if they were physical disks, making them somewhat useful as a universal archive format.</p>
<p>Console emulators, such as Virtual Clone drive, can read from CD/DVD, are able to run ISO/BIN (and other similar formats) instead of running directly from the CD drive.<br /> 
  Better performance is achieved by running an ISO instead of a CD/DVD since there is no waiting for the drive to be ready and the hard drive I/O speed is many times faster than the CD/DVD drive.</p>

<h2>Creating an ISO image in UltimateBurner 3.0 </h2>
<ol>
  <li>Install UltimateBurner3.0 onto your computer. A copy is available in the ReadOnly folder of class storage. Ultimate Burner  will be installed in C:\Program Files(x86)\UltimateBurner\<br />
  </li>
  <li>Open Windows Explorer and navigate to 'C:\Program Files (x86)\UltimateBurner\' </li>
  <li>Double click burner.exe to start the program. You can drag the icon to your desktop or Quick Launch bar if you like. </li>
  <li>Select the files you want to add to your ISO image from the left pane and drag them to the right pane. <br />

  </li>
  <li>When you are done selecting files click the 'Build ISO' button. <br />
    Enter the path where the file will be created.<br />
    <br />
  <img src="BuildISOUltimate.png" width="300" height="137" /> </li>
</ol>
<p>That is it. Your ISO file will have an .iso extension and is ready to be used to burn a CD image, or to be mounted for use by other programs, or to serve as a CD drive in VMware Workstation or Fusion.<br />
